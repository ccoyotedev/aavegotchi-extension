> This project aims to provide a simple chrome extenstion that allows you to view and pet your Aavegotchis.

## 🎉 Features

- **View Gotchi**

## 📝 Description

It's built using React and uses web3 + Metamask to connect to the Aavegotchi contract.

## 📝 Notes

Currently not possible to connect Metamask to the webpage within the popup. Instead one must load a page already connected to Metamask or connect Metamask to the current page and refresh.

Once contract is connected, the gotchis data is stored in Chromes storage.
